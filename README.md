## The DC Government

A set of scrapers and parsers to create bulk data (JSON metadata, original documents, extracted text) for:

* Bills introduced by the DC Council (from [Open States](http://openstates.org/))
* Current Council members (from [Open States](http://openstates.org/))
* Proposed and final regulations (from the [DC Register](http://www.dcregs.dc.gov/Gateway/IssueList.aspx))

Expansions could include additional DC Register information (e.g. notices, mayoral orders, hearings), and adapting @tmcw's [DC Municipal Regulations parser](/tmcw/dcmr).

## Status

No code has been written! Expect some groundwork to be laid before [the Open DC Code Hackathon](http://dccode.eventbrite.com/) on April 14th, and for lots of work to be done on it there.
